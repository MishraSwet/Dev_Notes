Cloudflare workers is the serverless features provided by Cloudflare similiar to AWS Lambda.
Serverless scales depending upon the load and no fixed cost is associated its easier to setup and we pay as per the number of requests.
It does take time to cold-start as for the first request a server needs to be started-up.
