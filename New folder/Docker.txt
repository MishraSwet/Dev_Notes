Docker lets us runs program inside our computer with needing for us to install it.
It runs the program inside a container(a virutal mini computer inside our computer)
A container has its own processing,file-system,network etc
A request to the port of a container doest necessarily transport the request to the port of our pc for that we do port forwarding
To run programs we look for docker images to run which consist of all the instructions to run a program..
